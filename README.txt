Coding Project #2
Name: Aiden Synkova
Course; CPSC 221 2016W2 offering

*************************************************************************************
Parts implemented by me: max_heap.cpp, string_bst.cpp, several test cases in main.cpp

All other code was provided by UBC's Department of Computer Science
*************************************************************************************

For the output.txt, I copied every output from the terminal, but separated my
tests from the ones we were given, so they are easily recognizable.

The swap_down function was partly based on the swapDown function used in lab 4.
Some commentary is also provided in the code.
